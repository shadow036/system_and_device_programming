/*
Code implementation with threads
(a variant of exercise 04, but with threads)
--------------------------------------------

Implement a C program, thread_generation, that receives a command line parameter
n.
The parent thread creates two threads and waits for their termination.
Each further thread creates the other two threads, and it awaits their termination.
Tread creation stops after 2^n threads have been created, i.e., the ones that stand
on the leaves of a tree with 2^n leaves.

For example, if n=3
- the main thread creates two threads
- each one of these 2 threads creates other two threads,
- each one of these 4 threads creates other two threads
at this point, 8 leaf treads are running and the program must stop.

Each leaf thread must print its generation tree, i.e., the sequence of thread
identifiers from the main thread (the tree root) to the leaf thread (tree leaf).

The following is an example of the program execution:

quer@quer-VirtualBox:~/current/sdp$ ./l01e05 3
140051327870720 140051311085312 140051224717056
140051327870720 140051311085312 140051224717056
140051327870720 140051311085312 140051233109760
140051327870720 140051319478016 140051207931648
140051327870720 140051311085312 140051233109760
140051327870720 140051319478016 140051207931648
140051327870720 140051319478016 140051216324352
140051327870720 140051319478016 140051216324352

Suggestion
----------
Print (and store) thread identifiers (tids) as "long integer"
values.
